#CSS final Assignment using the alternate template provided.

The purpose of this project was to style a site that is used as a todo list for people looking to keep better organized.

##Layout

I used a two column layout for the site with flex box and a 2 column layout on teh todo list using grid

The site is kept smaller as its primary use is for quick lits additions and removals to stay on top of tasks.

You do not want to be looking around a 1400px or larger site to find what you need when you just want to check "laundry" off your list. So most of the content was kept under 1000px with the main focus of the list taking up much less.
